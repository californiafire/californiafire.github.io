	    		Paradise, CA - The Camp Fire built in three.js.<br/>
	    	</h3>

	    	Sunday November 18th.  2018.<br/><br/><hr/><br>
	    	California.  My home.  It's bad out there.  Like, really bad.  
	    	<br/>
	    	Luckily, where I live isn't burning but the smoke is so thick that I can't really go outside.  It's like the usual fog of San Fransisco - except it isn't fog.

	    	<br/><br/>
	    	I was thinking that maybe if people could see the scale of the fire, they'd be more motivated to donate to people who lost homes or loved ones so I got inspired to build this 3D rendering. 

	    	<br/><br/> The outline is parsed KML data downloaded from <a href="https://google.org/crisismap/google.com/2018-camp-fire" target="_blank" class="mainlink"> Google Maps</a> and the image of California is from <a target="_blank" class="mainlink" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Atlas_of_California#Geography_maps"> Wikimedia.</a>  I got the death statistics from <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-news/fires-in-california-camp-woolsey-paradise-wildfire-evacuations-death-toll-map-2018-11-18-latest/" target="_blank" class="mainlink">CBSNews</a> and the homes lost statistic from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/16/us/california-fires/index.html" target="_blank" class="mainlink">CNN.</a>

			<br/><br/>
	    	I got the donate link from the <a href="https://disasterphilanthropy.networkforgood.com/projects/62496-cdp-california-wildfires-recovery-fund" target="_blank" class="mainlink">Center for Disaster Philanthropy</a> which I found through the google donations service.<br/><br/>

	    	<br/><br/><br/><br/>
	    	I'm just one nerd stuck in his room trying to help out where I can...<br/>

	    	...and after I post this, I'm going to go drop a fat donation.<br/><br/>

	    	Because there are people out there who need this money way more than I do right now. <br/><br/>
